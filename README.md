# Password Strength Checker and Security Analysis

This project analyzes and compares password strength using several methods and tools commonly used in cybersecurity environments. It highlights best practices, common attacks, and provides a visually styled HTML report.

## Tools Used

- **cracklib-check** : Validates password strength against basic policies
- **grep + rockyou.txt** : Simulates dictionary-based password attacks
- **Python scripts** : Custom scripts for analyzing entropy and structure
- **hashcat** : Demonstrates hash cracking performance

## Project Contents

- `Passwd_strength_checker.html`: Final styled report of password analysis
- Password examples categorized by complexity
- Tables showcasing analysis, attack types, and security tips

## How to Use

1. Open the `Passwd_strength_checker.html` file in any browser.
2. Review password examples and see how each fares under different tests.
3. Understand attack methods and learn how to defend against them.
4. Apply best practices listed to enhance your password security.

## Key Learnings

- Length beats complexity: A 25-character phrase is stronger than a 9-character mixed password.
- Randomized strings like `xK8#qP$2mL!9zR*5` are highly secure.
- Avoid reused passwords , credential stuffing attacks are common.
- Always enable 2FA for added protection.
